# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction System – Built a machine learning model using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers to predict loan approval based on applicant data. Performed data preprocessing, EDA, and deployed an interactive Gradio interface for real-time predictions.

# Loan Approval Prediction System

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details using multiple machine learning algorithms.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, label encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Trained multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and KNN
